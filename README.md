# kennydrift (me :D)

**Game Developer | Programmer | Website Builder**  
I Make games, bots, and cool projects with Python, Unity, and more.    

## Ongoing Projects  
- **Tski** â€“ A Discord bot with a bunch of features.. New
- **MOONVEIL** â€“ A novel I am currentling writing :O  
- **Reaper's Verdict** â€“ A indie game where you decide if people live or die  
- **Minecraft mods** â€“ I made so much I lost count, mostly API based mods

## Finished Project
- **Custom real life visit counter** â€“ Might sound lame, but I connected a website I made a while ago (Not currently active) to a digital counter in the real world. Not a phone or screen, like a legit homemade digital counter :?
- **AI powered discord bot** - Yeah, pretty simple to understand, connected a AI to discord
- **AI powered IRL bot** - On the theme of AI, this was very confusing to make, holy moly. So I connected gpt to a system that would read its messages out loud, like a text to speech voice. Then I connected it to a lego motor, was pretty fun.
